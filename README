PROPOSED STEPS:
	1. Get the seasons and years functions written.
	2. Get the seasons,hours and years to handle multiple data cols.
	3. Change the timeseries object to a list to make it easier to also display attributes, such as min, max,  equal time step etc.
TODO:
	* Update the help files for both days and month gag functions.
	* Add the following functions and provide code.
	* Provide examples for each function in the help documents.
	* Add the functions (seasons.agg, years.agg)
	* Write and add changing functions for each of the above of the aggregation methods above.
	*Remove copyright protected data files and add some non copyrighted stuff
	* PROPER TESTINGÉ
	* Get all the functions to handle multiple data cols.
	* As above for the hours.agg function, the days and months should be fine for multiple data cols.
	* Fix the names of the returned data.frame using hours.agg
PROBLEMS:
	1. Get hours.agg to return data <return(data)> so it gives output without being assigned to an object.
	2. As above for hours.change aswell (it does give the right headings).

WISHLIST:
	* Convert the timeSeries objects to list to include a summary and other components such as 
	* Get weeks to work. At present only can achieve this by using 7 days - This might be left as is, or use a merge of complete dataframe and incomplete type.
	* Add the ability to set the na.rm value as input rather than the current compulsory <na.rm=T>

COMPLETED:
	*Finished timeseries.R script works with warnings and error notifications.
	*Finished timeseries.Rd with working examples.
	*Finished days.agg script to handle multiple days and multiple data cols and incomplete datasets.
	*Finished months.agg script to handle multiple months, incomplete datasets and multiple data cols.
