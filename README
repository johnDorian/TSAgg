TODO:
	* Add the following functions and provide code.
	* Provide examples for each function in the help documents.
	* Add the functions (days.agg, months.agg, seasons.agg, years.agg)
	* Write and add changing functions for each of the above of the aggregation 
	methods above.
	* Add require(chron) to the package.
	* Add some data files for the examples.

PROBLEMS:
	1. Fix the names of the returned data.frame using hours.agg
	2. Get hours.agg to return data <return(data)> so it gives output without
	being assigned to an object.
	3. As above for hours.change aswell (it does give the right headings).

WISHLIST:
	* Get weeks to work. At present only can achieve this by using 7 days.
	* Add the ability to set the na.rm value as input rather than the current
	compulsory <na.rm=T>

COMPLETED:
	*Finished timeseries.R script works with warnings and error notifications.
	*Finished timeseries.Rd with working examples.
	*Added the ability for timeseries.R to handle multiple R columns.
